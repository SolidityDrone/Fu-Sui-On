# Sui Source Escrow with Gasless Transactions

A sophisticated source chain escrow system for Sui that enables **gasless partial fills** using **OpenZeppelin-compatible Merkle trees** with relayer signatures. This system allows takers to withdraw funds without paying gas fees through sponsored transactions.

## üéØ What This Does

This source escrow system enables **gasless cross-chain atomic swaps** where:

1. **Alice** (maker) locks funds on Sui with a Merkle root
2. **Bob** (taker) can withdraw funds without paying gas fees
3. **Relayer** sponsors transactions and provides signatures
4. **Multiple fillers** can partially fill using different Merkle tree leaves
5. **Secrets are shared** to unlock funds atomically

The system uses **OpenZeppelin's Merkle tree implementation** for compatibility with Solidity contracts, ensuring the same Merkle proofs work on both Sui and Ethereum.

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Merkle Tree Structure
```
Root = OpenZeppelin SimpleMerkleTree.of([secret1, secret2, secret3, secret4, secret5])

Leaves (10 parts system):
- secret1 = Parts 1-2 (20% of order)
- secret2 = Parts 3-4 (20% of order)  
- secret3 = Parts 5-6 (20% of order)
- secret4 = Parts 7-8 (20% of order)
- secret5 = Parts 9-10 (20% of order) + completion secret
```

### Gasless Transaction System
- **Relayer Sponsorship**: Relayer pays gas fees for taker transactions
- **Signature Verification**: Relayer signs withdrawal requests
- **Sponsored Transactions**: Takers execute without gas costs
- **Authorization**: Only relayer can authorize withdrawals

### Time Windows
- **SRC_WITHDRAWAL**: Only maker can withdraw (with secrets)
- **SRC_PUBLIC_WITHDRAWAL**: Anyone can withdraw (for maker)
- **SRC_CANCELLATION**: Maker gets refund

### Security Features
- **OpenZeppelin Merkle Proofs**: Cryptographic verification
- **Nullifier System**: Prevents double-spending
- **Relayer Authorization**: Only authorized relayer can sign withdrawals
- **Time-based Access Control**: Different permissions per window

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Sui CLI installed
- Node.js and npm
- Testnet SUI for gas fees (for relayer)

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo>
cd sui-escrows/srcEscrow

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Edit `.env` file:
```env
# Sui Network
NETWORK=testnet

# Private Keys (generate with: sui client new-address ed25519)
ALICE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_alice_private_key_here
BOB_PRIVATE_KEY=your_bob_private_key_here
RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_relayer_private_key_here

# Contract IDs (will be filled after deployment)
PACKAGE_ID=
FACTORY_ID=
FACTORY_VERSION=
```

### 3. Deploy Contract
```bash
# Deploy to testnet
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 --network testnet

# Copy the package ID from output
# Example: Published Objects: [0x1234...] Package: 0x5678...
```

### 4. Initialize Factory
```bash
# Initialize factory (replace with your package ID)
sui client call --package 0xYOUR_PACKAGE_ID --module srcescrow --function init_factory --gas-budget 10000000 --network testnet

# Copy the factory ID from output
# Example: Created Objects: [0xabcd...]
```

### 5. Update Environment
Update your `.env` file with the new IDs:
```env
PACKAGE_ID=0xYOUR_PACKAGE_ID
FACTORY_ID=0xYOUR_FACTORY_ID
FACTORY_VERSION=YOUR_FACTORY_VERSION
```

### 6. Install Dependencies & Test
```bash
# Install TypeScript dependencies
cd ts-test
npm install

# Run the test
npm run test
```

## üìã How to Get Required Values

### Private Keys
```bash
# Generate new addresses
sui client new-address ed25519
sui client new-address ed25519
sui client new-address ed25519

# Export private keys
sui client export-private-key <address>
```

### Package ID
After deployment, look for:
```
Published Objects: [0x1234...] Package: 0x5678...
```
The `Package: 0x5678...` is your `PACKAGE_ID`.

### Factory ID
After initialization, look for:
```
Created Objects: [0xabcd...]
```
The `0xabcd...` is your `FACTORY_ID`.

### Factory Version
Get the factory version:
```bash
sui client object 0xYOUR_FACTORY_ID --show-content
```
Look for `"version": "123"` in the output.

## üîÑ Gasless Transaction Flow

### 1. Alice Creates Escrow (Sui)
```typescript
// Alice locks 1 SUI with Merkle root
const escrow = await createEscrow(
    aliceKeypair,
    merkleRoot,
    beneficiaryAddress,
    1000000000 // 1 SUI
);
```

### 2. Relayer Generates Signature
```typescript
// Relayer signs withdrawal request for Bob
const relayerSignature = await generateRelayerSignature(
    escrowId,
    secrets,
    merkleProofs,
    relayerKeypair
);
```

### 3. Bob Withdraws Gaslessly
```typescript
// Bob withdraws without paying gas (relayer sponsors)
await withdrawWithRelayerSignature(
    escrowId,
    secrets,
    merkleProofs,
    relayerSignature,
    bobKeypair // Bob doesn't need SUI for gas
);
```

### 4. Relayer Pays Gas, Bob Gets Funds
```typescript
// Relayer pays gas fees
// Bob receives funds directly
// Transaction is sponsored by relayer
```

## üß™ Testing

### Run Full Test Suite
```bash
cd ts-test
npm run test
```

### Test Output
```

    merkleRoot: merkleTree.root,
    beneficiary: "0x...",
    deadline: Date.now() + 3600000

```typescript
// Relayer service endpoint
app.post('/withdraw', async (req, res) => {
    const { escrowId, secrets, merkleProofs } = req.body;
    
    // Generate signature
    const signature = await generateRelayerSignature(
        escrowId,
        secrets,
        merkleProofs,
        relayerKeypair
    );
    
    // Execute sponsored transaction
